## Creating the virtual Environment and Django Setup

- We need to create a virtual environment

   ```
- Once the environment is created we need to activate it with a  command:

  ```bash
  source <environmentname>/bin/activate
  ```
  
- The next step is to install the DJANGO in the environment.

 ```bash
   python3 -m pip install Django
  ```

```bash
